#AWS Data Lifecycle Management Helper
The purpose of adlm-helper is to ease the EBS policy management of the new AWS feature [DLM](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/07/introducing-amazon-data-lifecycle-manager-for-ebs-snapshots/) overhead. It allows one to focus managing the policies rather than the execution.
